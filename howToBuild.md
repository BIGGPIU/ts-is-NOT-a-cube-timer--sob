# How to Build this project

For this project you'll need

* 1x Arduino Uno
* 2x any standard keyboard switch
* 4x wires
* 10x M3 screws
* A soldering iron
* Solder 
* A way to strip wires 

Also you dont need to have it but it would be better if you have 

## Step 1: 3d print case

This part should be kind of obvious but if you want to make this project you should probably 3d print the case first and gather the rest of your materials.

## step 2: Assemble stuff

1. Screw down arduino uno, you dont have to have each screw screwed down but just make sure you have at least one on each side. Dont screw in too tight
2. Estimate how much wire you'll need to connect pins GND,2,9 and GND again to each of the keyboard switches 

    NOTE: I personally have my wires connected to the GND pin right above Vin and above digital pin 13 but theres nothing stopping you from having them connected to other gnd pins
3. strip the wires and insert them in the arduino to confirm the length is all good
4. Strip the other end of the wire
5. Solder the end thats not in the arduino to the keyboard switch

Once you've flashed the arduino you should be all good to go. You can choose to screw in the plates at the bottom of the switches if you want to but it'll work just fine regardless
