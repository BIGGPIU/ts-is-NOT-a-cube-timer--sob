# Step 1: flash arduino
This step is kind of self explanatory, download the source code in the Arduino folder, you can either flash your Arduino via the Arduino IDE or Vscode its up to you
# Step 2: Run yandev.py
Whenever you want to use your dollar tree ahh timer you must run yandev.py to turn the serial outputs sent by the arduino to keyboard input.
